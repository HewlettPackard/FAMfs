               BurstFS: A Distributed Burst Buffer File System - 0.1.1
===============================================================================

Please note that the current implementation of BurstFS is not of production 
quality, and is for research purposes only.  

How to build (with CRUISE tests):
1. download and build leveldb-1.14 (wget https://github.com/google/leveldb/archive/v1.14.tar.gz). 
   Then, change the path in BurstFS_Meta/Makefile.cfg to point to your leveldb directory  
2. change directory to BurstFS_Meta
   make
3. change directory to BurstFS_Client
   ./buildme_opt
   cd tests
   ./buildme.sh
4. change directory to BurstFS_Server
   ./buildme_autotools (the first time you build the server only)
   ./buildme.sh

How to run (with CRUISE tests): 
1. Make sure you are in BurstFS_Server directory
2. allocate a node 
3. ./runserver.sh
4. ./runwrclient.sh

Note: If at Oak Ridge you will probably have to change the MPI path as well in BurstFS_Meta/Makefile.cfg in the 1st build step.
